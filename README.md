CanSat 2024/25 Competiton

This is a tool developed from scratch that allows atmospheric sensor data (such as pressure, altitude, temperature, velocity, acceleration, and time) 
to be visualized and rendered graphically in real-time.

It was initially developed for the Pi Pico W but is compatable with any microcontroller with wifi connectivity.
